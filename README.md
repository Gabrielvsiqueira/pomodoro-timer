## ðŸš€ About the Project
This project was conceived as a customized implementation of the Pomodoro technique, aimed at enhancing personal organization. The application includes the following features:

* Task List: Allows the user to record and manage daily tasks, facilitating prioritization and tracking of activities to be completed.

* Timer: The project includes a timer that can be started and paused through dedicated buttons:

* Start: Starts the timer, allowing the user to focus on the task at hand for a defined period.

 * Pause: Stops the timer and resets the count, providing flexibility to the user.

This system was developed to assist in time management and improve productivity, integrating the Pomodoro technique with an intuitive and functional interface.
